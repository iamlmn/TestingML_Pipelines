# TestingML_Pipelines
My notes on software testing  ML pipelines


Some machine learning applications are intended
to learn properties of data sets where the correct
answers are not already known to human users. It is
challenging to test such ML software, because there is
no reliable test oracle. We describe a software testing
approach aimed at addressing this problem. We
present our findings from testing implementations of
two different ML ranking algorithms: Support Vector
Machines and MartiRank.
